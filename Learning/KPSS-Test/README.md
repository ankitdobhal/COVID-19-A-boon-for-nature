# Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin Test
**KPSS** or **Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin** is another test for checking the stationarity of a time series. It is a type of Unit root test that tests for the stationarity of a given series around a deterministic trend.

# KPSS Test
KPSS test is a type of statistical test in which null and alternate hypothesis are opposite to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller or ADF test.
The Null and Alternate hypothesis of the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test is defined as follows:

* Null hypothesis as the process is trend stationary, which means Stationarity exists
* Alternate hypothesis of a unit root series, which means Stationarity does not exists.

# Difference b/w ADF and KPSS Test
- A key difference from ADF test is the null hypothesis of the KPSS test is that the series is stationary.

- So practically, the interpretaion of p-value is just the opposite to each other.

- That is, if p-value is < signif level (say 0.05), then the series is non-stationary. Whereas in ADF test, it would mean the tested series is  stationary.

# Test for stationarity
- If **p-value < 0.05(critical value)** means the series is non stationary.
- Else  series is stationary.
